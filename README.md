# chess-ui

Ever found yourself in the unfortunate situation where you have spent so much time building and training a chess engine only to not be able to experience the joy of playing against it? Fear not! This repo gives you exactly that opportunity! All you have to do to play against your trained engine is:

1) Create an endpoint for your chess engine
2) Run the docker file in this repo
3) Open your browser to localhost
4) Start playing against it!

As an example, I have trained a chess engine here:

A chess game in browser where only legal moves are allowed. 

The user can make moves with white and black makes moves in return. 
The purpose of this repo is to provide a structure where the user is able
to play against a chess engine that he himself trained.

# Todo:
    Add an option where the user can choose if he want to play against the trained engine
    or a predetermined engine level (maybe a dropdown?)
